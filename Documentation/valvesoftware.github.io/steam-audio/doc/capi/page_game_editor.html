<div class="textblock"><p>If you want to use the sound propagation, reverb, or occlusion functionality of Steam Audio, your game engine must provide information about the objects in your scene, for use by audio engine components that call into Steam Audio functionality (see <a class="el" href="page_audio_engine.html">Audio Engine Integration</a>).</p>
<p>Before you can do this, you must add necessary functionality to your game engine's editor so it can generate the data needed by Steam Audio. This page describes each piece of functionality that must be added, but only provides general guidelines and examples of how to implement it: the specifics will vary significantly depending on your game engine.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="editor_scene"></a>
Scene Export</h1>
<p>The game engine needs to tell Steam Audio what geometric objects comprise your scene, and what their acoustic material properties are. To this end, the game engine's editor must expose controls that let the user specify this information.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="editor_scene_geometry"></a>
Selecting Geometry</h2>
<p>The editor needs to have some way for the user to specify which geometric objects should be used by Steam Audio for simulation. There are multiple ways of going about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a component or flag to each object that must be exported to Steam Audio. This object may be as large as a mountain, or as small as a tin can, or even an individual triangle.</li>
<li>Create a special layer for acoustic objects. All meshes, terrain, or other geometry that is placed in this layer can be exported to Steam Audio.</li>
<li>Require users to create special <em>acoustic geometry</em> for export to Steam Audio. While this may require more up-front setup work, it also brings added flexibility in that users may tune the geometry so that it generates the desired acoustic effects without being any more complex that it needs to be.</li>
<li>Simply export everything to Steam Audio. This is the simplest option, but is unlikely to be the best choice. This is because not all objects influence the acoustics of a space equally: for example, a large shipping container can modify the reverb of a warehouse, but a small tin can is unlikely to do so.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="editor_scene_materials"></a>
Specifying Materials</h2>
<p>Every object that is exported to Steam Audio must have a corresponding acoustic material. This may be specified as a separate component added to objects that are exported to Steam Audio.</p>
<p>You may also provide a scene-wide default material setting. This way, if a large portion of the scene is made of the same material, the user does not have to spend time configuring a large number of geometric objects in the same way.</p>
<p>If your game engine models a hierarchy of objects in the scene (most do), you can use this to simplify the specification of materials too. You can implement an acoustic material component that applies to whatever object it is attached to, and all of its children, unless overridden by another acoustic material component.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may wish to extend any existing material system your game engine has, so that you can specify visual, physics, and acoustic materials for objects at the same time.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="editor_baking"></a>
Baking</h1>
<p>If you plan to use baked sound propagation or reverb effects, the game engine editor must allow the designer to place probes at which sound propagation and/or reverb data is baked; it must also provide controls for the designer to bake sound propagation and/or reverb data.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="editor_baking_probes"></a>
Placing Probes</h2>
<p>Probes are placed by specifying an axis-aligned bounding box within which probes are to be generated by Steam Audio. The editor must allow the user to place and size an axis-aligned box, select a probe generation algorithm, and use Steam Audio to generate probes within the box.</p>
<p>The editor must also save the probe-related data in an appropriate location, such as in a separate asset file, or serialized into the scene itself.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="editor_baking_bake"></a>
Generating Baked Data</h2>
<p>The editor must allow the designer to generate baked data for one or more probe boxes. This baked data may be baked reverb, baked sound propagation from a static source, or baked sound propagation from a moving source to a static listener. The baked data will be automatically saved to the same location as the rest of the data associated with the probe boxes.</p>
<p>Since baking is a time-consuming operation, Steam Audio allows the editor to provide callbacks for monitoring the progress of the bake operation. This can be used to display a progress bar within the editor window. </p>
